WARNING: This program is still under development.  It does not yet have a number of
features that most IDEs have, and the UI is still being improved.  While it is useful as
a demonstration of the basic code necessary to create an IDE, I do not yet recommend using
it for writing serious Python code.

This is a simple IDE for the Python programming language.  It is written in Python; the
GUI was written using TkInter.  It is licensed under the MIT license; read LICENSE.txt for
more information.

Installation: To run the IDE, it is necessary to have Python (and its standard libraries)
installed on your computer.  However, it is not necessary to install additional libraries.

Use: To begin using this IDE, run ide.py like a normal python file.
